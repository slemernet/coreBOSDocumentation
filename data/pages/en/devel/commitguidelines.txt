====== Commit Guidelines we try to adhere to ======

[[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QrDFcIiPjSLDn3EL15IJygNPiHORgU1_OOAqWjiDU5Y/mobilebasic?pli=1|AngularJS Git Commit Message Conventions]]

<code><type>(<scope>) <subject></code>

another way of reading that is:

<code>what(where) how</code>

in this second form, the //when// and //who// are controlled by git itself, so sign your commits.

Some additional clarifications:

  * Any line of the commit message cannot be longer 100 characters! This allows the message to be easier to read on GitHub as well as in various git tools.
  * Allowed **<type>**
    * **feat**: feature
    * **adapt**: this is a feature, but it only affects a particular install, not the whole coreBOS project
    * **fix**: bug fix
    * **security**
    * **i18n**: translation strings and enhancements
    * **docs**: documentation
    * **style**: formatting, missing semi colons, …
    * **refactor**: code refactor
    * **test**: when adding missing tests
    * **chore**: maintenance tasks
  * Allowed **<scope>** could be anything specifying place of the commit change. For example a module name, webservice or functional feature
  * **<subject>** line contains succinct description of the change. Use imperative, present tense: “change” not “changed” nor “changes”.
    * If the commit fixes or is related to a ticket put the title or a summary of it, the actual ticket number is rather useless as time has taught me that ticket systems come and go while code and commit messages persist.
