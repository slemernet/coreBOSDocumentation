====== How to add a special block to a module using templates ======

The goal of this tutorial is to show how we could add a new block in the edit or detail view of a module where we could add some special functionality that we may need.

To use this strategy you simply have to create a template with the same label as the block followed by //_edit// or //_detail// inside the module's template directory.

Inside that file, you will be able to use all the variables and functionality of Smarty and a new //$FIELDS// variable which contains the values of the fields of the record being shown/edited.

No additional functionality is given. You, as a programmer, must create the code to do any magic you need inside this block.

If you need to add a new block this can be done easily both in the layout editor and by using vtlib API.

Next, I am going to walk through a simple example by creating a new block called **Process Workflow** which will show an image to move to next phase of a given business process if it is possible in //Detail View// and a status message in //Edit View//.

To create the block we use this vtlib code:

<WRAP center round info 80%>
We could use the module manager "Add Block" feature with the same result.
</WRAP>


<code PHP>
$modname = 'Potentials';
$module = Vtiger_Module::getInstance($modname);
if ($module) {
	$block = new Vtiger_Block();
	$block->label = 'ProcessWorkflow';
	$block->sequence = 2;
	$module->addBlock($block);
} else {
	echo "<b>Failed to find $modname module.</b><br>";
}
</code>

Now that we have the block we create the files:

<code>
Smarty/templates/modules/Potentials/ProcessWorkflow_edit.tpl
Smarty/templates/modules/Potentials/ProcessWorkflow_detail.tpl
</code>

In //ProcessWorkflow_detail.tpl// I will put this code:

<code PHP>
<tr>
<td>
<p align="center"><img src="themes/images/right.gif" width="100px"/></p>
<p align="center">Move to next step in process</p>
</td>
</tr>
</code>

And in //ProcessWorkflow_edit.tpl// I will put this code:

<code PHP>
<tr>
<td colspan="4">
<p align="center">You are now in Step X of the Process and you can proceed to Step Y or Step Z</p>
</td>
</tr>
</code>
