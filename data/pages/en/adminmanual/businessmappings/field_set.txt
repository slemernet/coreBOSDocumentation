====== Field Set Mapping ======

The purpose of this mapping is to define a heterogeneous set of fields that belong to some modules. Simply a bunch of fields. This could be used to define a set of fields to launch a mass operation upon or a set of fields which must be excluded/included from some global process.

The accepted format is:
<code xml>
 <map>
  <module>
  <name>ModuleName</name>
  <fields>
	<field>
	  <name>fieldname</name>
	  <info>anything you need</info>
	</field>
  .....
  </fields>
  </module>
  ....
 </map>
</code>

You will be able to get the set of fields using the getFieldSet() method, and the fields on one module with the getFieldSetModule($module) method.
