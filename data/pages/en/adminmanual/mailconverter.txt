===== Mail Converter =====

This feature permits Configuring an IMAP mailbox to scan for messages and convert them to appropriate entities in the application.

Mail Converter adds the capability to scan your mailbox and take actions on messages that matches the established criteria.

The main functionality it was created for is to manage the Help Desk workflow with the logic that can be seen in the next image:

The Regular expression to process tickets correctly is:
<code>Re: TT[0-9]+ \[ Ticket Id : [0-9]+ \] (.+)</code>
What we put in the last block of parenthesis is what the application uses to match the ticket, if it is a number it will look for the CRMID if not it will look for the subject of the ticket.

==== Configure Mailbox  ====

You can access the Converter in **Settings -> Mail Converter**

You need to provide the mailbox information on which the scan needs to be performed. By default the mailbox will be disabled as no information is available.

Make sure that the status is //Enable// before saving the mailbox information. Scan will not be performed if the status is //Disable//

Provide configuration details to establish connection with your mail server and click on the Save button; As a result, all the available folder names will be fetched. If the connection fails the information will not be saved.

==== Rule criteria ====

Rule criteria are evaluated as follows: 

^From|Check for the input occurrence in the FROM field of the email|
^To|Check for the input occurrence in the TO field of the email|
^Subject|Compare the input with SUBJECT of email using one of the condition selected (Contains, Not Contains, Equals, Not Equals, Begins With, Not Begins With, Regex)|
^Body|Compare the input with BODY of email using one of the condition selected (Contains, Not Contains, Equals, Not Equals, Begins With, Not Begins With)|
^Match|**All Condition** – All the input conditions should evaluate as true to take Action|
| |**Any Condition** – At least one condition should evaluate as true to take Action|


Once a successful matching on an email occurs, the action will be applied on it as follows: 

^Create Ticket|Creates a new trouble ticket record with the following:\\ Title = SUBJECT of email\\ Description = BODY of email\\ Attachments of email will be linked to the trouble ticket record|
| |Lookup is made for existing Contact/Account based on FROM field of email and ticket is associated to matching record (if found)|
^Update Ticket|Updates existing trouble ticket record with the following:\\ Comment = BODY of email|
| |Lookup is made on existing trouble ticket based on FROM field of email and title or CRMID match. Preferable to select //Regex// as Subject and paste the following code in the text area <code>Ticket Id[^:]?: ([0-9]+)</code>|
