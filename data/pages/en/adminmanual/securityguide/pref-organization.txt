The first chapter of this book deals with security concept only, i.e. there are no prerequisites in terms of setting up vtiger CRM. It is helpful to have a basic knowledge of security-related concepts and terms. With regard to the real world example, however, having access to a CRM installation would obviously be an advantage as you could duplicate the setup and investigate your own tweaks to the security configuration.\\

Part I: Introduction explains how to use this manual and how to start to work with vtiger CRM \\
