==== What are they and what are they used for ====

{{ :es:extensions:extensions:segmentacion.jpg|Segmentation}}
List segmentation is exactly what it sounds like -- you divide up your contacts into a bunch of smaller lists, or segments, based on criteria you set.

These segments can be cut and combined in a number of different ways based on lead intelligence. For instance, you can segment your contacts based on psychographics, demographics, industry, company size -- you name it.

Segmentation is important because it helps you better target and personalize your campaigns and content. With better targeting comes better conversion rates -- because you're sending the most relevant information possible to your contacts.

This module allows you to group Accounts, Contacts, and Leads in different lists with which we can perform joint marketing actions.

You can fill in the lists in different ways, from workflows, through filters, reports or from the OpenStreetMap integration.

For example, we have a segmentation list of all the people who have registered to the BLOG of coreBOS. As soon as they are registered, the contact is created in our coreBOS and added to the BLOG segmentation list. When we publish something new we massively send an email to everyone on the list.

==== How to relate entities with a segmentation ====

We have 3 ways to add or remove accounts, contacts and leads to a segmentation list.

=== Manual ===

It is the traditional way, in which we access the related lists of the segmentation and select or add accounts, contacts and/or leads.

With this option every time we add or remove an entity in the system we must remember to go to the corresponding segmentation and make the relevant operations.

=== Synchronized Filter ===

To avoid having to remember to synchronize the segmentation we have added the option to link a filter to the segmentation. In this way, we can create a filter in accounts (for example) and have all the accounts contained in the filter directly available in the segmentation without doing any additional task.


=== Workflows ===

Through the workflow task **Add/Remove Segmentation List** we can add and remove accounts, contacts and leads individually when certain actions occur in the system.

The biggest advantage with respect to the synchronized filter option is that we can mix records with very different conditions instead of having only those that belong to a filter.

=== Marketing Dashboard ===

By massively selecting different entities based on different combinations of filters we can easily fill in segmentation lists.

=== OpenStreetMap Integration ===

When creating a radius search on the map we can find an option to send all the records contained inside the circle to a segmentation list.
